# Configuration overrides to make use of Test-Containers with MySQL
# Intended to be layered on top of application-test.yml
# i.e. when activating the 'tc-mysql' environment, also activate 'test'

# Custom Configuration for MySQL/TestContainer usage.  Needed to have a SINGLE container for both JDBC and R2DBC.
# This custom setup is why we do NOT define "datasources" and "r2dbc.datasources" in this file.
# See: MySQLContainerConfiguration for how this is used
